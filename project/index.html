            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are the hub of a large community of American Civil War reenactors. Our mission is to connect people 
                with American Civil War reenactment. Ranging from people who heard about it recently to seasoned reenactors 
                who moved and want to find a new unit near them. We also can direct new people to places where they can get 
                their reenactment gear from both sides.
